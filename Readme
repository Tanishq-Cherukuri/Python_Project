🦠 COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (USA): 2020–2022
This project provides a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 in the United States over a two-year period (July 2020 – July 2022). Leveraging a large dataset from Kaggle, we uncover trends in confirmed cases, deaths, mortality rates, and state-wise impacts. The analysis is intended to inform public health understanding and showcase how data science can reveal meaningful insights in a global crisis.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze nationwide and state-level trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and mortality rates.

Identify the states most affected in terms of confirmed cases and fatalities.

Explore time-series trends and the effectiveness of pandemic control measures.

Communicate findings using compelling data visualizations.

🗂 Dataset Overview
Source: Kaggle - COVID-19 US Dataset

🧾 Conclusion
This project highlights the uneven impact of COVID-19 across U.S. states, with densely populated states like New York and California facing the highest toll. The exploratory analysis shows how government interventions helped flatten the curve from 2021 onwards. Visual analytics proved invaluable in communicating the scale and timeline of the pandemic.

📌 Takeaway: Data-driven health surveillance is critical for shaping timely policy responses during public health crises.
